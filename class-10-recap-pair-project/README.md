# Class 10 - Recap

- Please review the requirements for today's assignment in the corresponding "pair-assignment" directory.
- We have included a "past-projects" file in this directory that demo's a few of the final projects from previous cohorts. Please review these to get an idea of what you might want to do for your final project.  Remember, proper planning can often times be the determining factor of a successful project!
