# Portfolio Assignment for Class 12 - REST and API's

In our blog, we used RESTful routes to interact with the Github API.  It's time to take this a step further and integrate this functionality into your portfolio project.

To get started, you will need to create a controller that includes a call to the Github API. This call should grab data about your individual account, and render portions of the returned content to the page, **once the data has been loaded**.  This is fairly open ended, so use whatever data you deem fit and be sure to separate your concerns.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Ensure your code passes ESLint.
 - Place all code within the proper layer of MVC abstraction and encapsulation.
 - Make an ajax call to the GitHub API to dynamcially pull in your repo data. Remember to put your GitHub personal access token in a separate JS file, set as a global var - for the time being.
 - Keep your portfolio responsive as it displays API data.
 - DO NOT publish your GitHub Token to any public repo.
